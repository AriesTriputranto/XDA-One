### Compiling

XDA One is developed using the [Android Studio IDE](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) and Gradle. A simple debug build can be compiled using the XDA-One:assembleSimpleDebug gradle task.

For directions/howto on compiling in Android Studio, see https://github.com/xda/XDA-One/wiki/Compiling

### Contributing

XDA One will adopt the "Fork & pull" model of collaboration. Collaborators are encouraged to fork the project and submit pull requests for XDA's review, in order to be integrated back into the main release.

If you wish to design a major change, please let us know what API endpoints we can create to help your goals. Although we can't promise everything, we will do our best to accomodate new features via the API.
